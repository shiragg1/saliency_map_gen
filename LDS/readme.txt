The source code implements the saliency model described in the published work:
"Learning Discriminative Subspaces on Random Contrasts for Image Saliency Analysis", Shu Fang, Jia Li, Yonghong Tian, Tiejun Huang, Xiaowu Chen, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS), 2016.

NOTES:
===========
./demo.m     % the demo script showing the usage of function "GetSaliencyMap"
./GetSaliencyMap.m  % the function that generates a saliency map

Need the code of gbvs. It is already included in the "external" folder. 

The saliency map may be slightly different from those reported in the paper because of the random contrast map.
